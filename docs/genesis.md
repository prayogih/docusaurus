## What is Genesis Mining program?
Genesis Mining program is the initial TAD distribution that will be distributed to TEN holders. To participate this program, you need to hold some TEN tokens and stake them through Tadpole Finance app.

By the time the TAD token is generated, 200,000 TAD will be transferred to "Genesis Mining" smart contract. TEN holders can then start staking in the smart contract by depositing some TEN to get TAD as a reward. For every 1 ethereum block, 0.975 TAD will be distributed proportionally to each miner according to the portion of TEN staked compared to the total TEN staked by all miners. After 205000 ethereum blocks or about 30 days, Genesis Mining will end so that the total supply for Genesis Mining will be 100% distributed.

## How much of TAD is distributed through this program?
Total of 200,000 TAD will be distributed through this program.

## How long is the Genesis Mining period?
Genesis Mining will start on 13 October 2020 and will last for about 30 days (205000 ethereum blocks).
